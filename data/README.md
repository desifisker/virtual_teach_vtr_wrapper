## Data

This README exists to aid in structuring the file system of VirT&R. This folder is where the majority of intermediate data products will be stored during the creation of a virtual teach map.

The videos and gps data from a drone flight should be placed here to begin with, and helper functions will assume so, in addition to use this directory to save and move intermediate data prodcuts to and from.
